### Features
- **AI-powered trading bots**: AI-driven algorithms to analyze market trends and execute trades.
- **Integration with Safe Wallet**: Secure asset management via Safe multisig wallets.
- **Optimized for Cow Swap**: Leveraging CoW Swap's batch auction mechanism to minimize front-running and slippage.
- **Gas fee reduction**: Smart transaction batching to lower transaction costs.
- **Customizable strategies**: Users can deploy and adjust AI-based trading strategies.
- **Trading agent integration with CoW Protocol**: Ensures all trades are executed within CoW Protocol for security and efficiency.
- **Smart contract infrastructure with Zodiac role modifiers**: Restricts trading to approved tokens only.
- **Governance mechanism for token holders**: Enables community-driven management of the token allowlist.
- **Safety checks and parameter controls**: Prevents unauthorized trades and ensures compliance with defined trading rules.

### Architecture
1. **AI Trading Engine**: Machine learning models process market data and make trading decisions.
2. **Safe Wallet Integration**: Ensures secure asset storage and management.
3. **Cow Swap Execution Layer**: Executes trades via CoW Swapâ€™s batch auction system.
4. **Smart Contract Infrastructure**: Utilizes Zodiac role modifiers to enforce trading restrictions.
5. **Governance Mechanism**: Token holders manage allowlists and trading permissions.
6. **Backend & API Services**: Facilitates data processing and bot execution.
